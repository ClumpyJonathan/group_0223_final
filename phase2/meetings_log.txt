Meeting 5 - Tuesday, 03 March @ Lab
- Talked with Brenna TA, she gave us advice on how to simplify design
- Some overhauls needed:
- Will add a user class
- Will remove all creator classes (this can be done by Calendar)
- Added managers for alerts, events, memos, series

- New assignments:
- Alex: Calendar, user manager, user
- Danial: Data manager
- Jonathan: Interface, Main
- Emily: Event, Memo, Alert, Series

Changelog Monday 02 March 10:20pm
- Danial suggested that events should have a static variable to keep track of the number of existing events
- And that way they can assign their own ID when they are created
- instead of EventCreator keeping track and assigning them an ID

- Danial also suggested having Series/Memos/Alerts etc track the ID of the event they are associated with
- As opposed to keeping a reference to the event they are associated with

- Changes discussed over facebook chat
