#### PHASE 1

Due to the way we've organized file paths, please run the program from the group_0223 folder.

If that doesn't work (sorry! this was really tricky to figure out) then go into phase1/src/UserManager.java and edit FILE_PATH to equal "src/users.json"

Use the username Danial and the password abcd when logging in.

We also have a JSON library that we use (phase1/json-simple-1.1), please make sure that's marked in IntelliJ as a library.
